# BDD .NET â€“ Beer-Driven Development Example in .NET

This repository demonstrates how to implement **Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)** in a .NET environment using C# and Gherkin. It contains a sample application (`WeatherInfo`) and corresponding integration tests (`WeatherInfo.IntegrationTests`) that define behavior using Gherkin feature files and test them using Reqnroll.

   git clone https://github.com/jpourdanis/bdd-dotnet.git
   cd bdd-dotnet
   ```

2. **Restore dependencies**

   ```bash
   dotnet restore
   ```

3. **Run the BDD Integration Tests**

   Navigate to the integration tests project and run:

   ```bash
   cd WeatherInfo.IntegrationTests
   dotnet test
   ```

   This will run all tests defined in the `.feature` files using Reqnroll.

## ðŸ“Š Viewing the Test Report

After running the tests, an Allure HTML report is generated with attachments.

To view the report locally :

   ```bash
   cd WeatherInfo.IntegrationTests/bin/Debug/net9.0
   allure generate
   allure serve
   ```
